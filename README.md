## 3. Reflection
Through this assignment, I learned the fundamentals of HTML and how to create a basic webpage from scratch. I now understand how different tags work together to structure text, display media, and collect user input. The optional challenge of using tables for layout helped me realize why CSS is usually preferred for modern web design. Overall, this project gave me confidence in building and presenting my first webpage.
